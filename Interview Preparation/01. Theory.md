# ACID properties
## Atomicity
- Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. 
- Either all the changes made by the transaction are applied, or none of them are. 
- If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database is left unchanged.

### Example
- Suppose you want to transfer money from your account to another account. 
- The transaction includes deducting the amount from your account and adding it to the other account. 
- If any part of the transaction fails (e.g., due to an error or interruption), the money should not be deducted from your account, and the transfer should not occur.

## Consistency
- Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another valid state. 
- It means that a transaction should maintain the integrity constraints and rules defined in the database schema.

### Example
- Let's say you have a database table that stores customer information, and one of the constraints is that the age of a customer must be greater than 18. 
- If a transaction tries to insert a record with an age of 16, the consistency property ensures that the transaction is aborted, and the database remains in a consistent state.

## Isolation
- Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. 
- Each transaction should execute as if it is the only transaction running on the system, even if there are multiple transactions executing simultaneously.

### Example
- Imagine two users simultaneously updating the same database record. 
- Isolation ensures that each user's transaction is isolated from the other, so one user's changes do not interfere or affect the other user's changes. 
- This prevents data inconsistencies and ensures the transactions are executed in a correct and isolated manner.

## Durability
- Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed and changes are written to the database, they will persist even in the event of system failures or power outages. 
- The changes made by a committed transaction should be permanent and survive any subsequent system restarts.

### Example
- After a successful transaction that updates customer information in the database, the changes should be durably stored and remain intact even if the system crashes or loses power. 
- This ensures that the data is not lost and can be reliably retrieved in the future.

## What is SQL?
- SQL is a programming language specifically designed for managing relational databases. 
- It provides a set of commands and statements used to communicate with a database, perform data manipulation, retrieval, and database management operations.

## What are the different types of SQL statements?
There are mainly three types of SQL statement
### Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements
- Used for manipulating and querying data, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
### Data Definition Language (DDL) statements
- Used for defining and managing the structure of the database, such as CREATE, ALTER, DROP.
### Data Control Language (DCL) statements
- Used for managing user access and permissions, such as GRANT, REVOKE.

## What is a primary key?
- A primary key is a unique identifier for a row in a database table. 
- It uniquely identifies each record in the table and ensures data integrity. 
- A primary key cannot contain duplicate or null values.

## What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?
- UNION and UNION ALL are used to combine the result sets of two or more SELECT statements.
### UNION
- Returns the distinct rows from the combined result sets, eliminating duplicates.

### UNION ALL
- Returns all rows from the combined result sets, including duplicates.

## What is a foreign key?
- A foreign key is a field or a set of fields in a database table that refers to the primary key of another table. 
- It establishes a relationship between two tables, enforcing referential integrity. 
- A foreign key ensures that data in the referencing table (child table) corresponds to data in the referenced table (parent table).

## What is normalization in SQL?
- Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to eliminate redundancy and dependency. 
- It involves breaking down larger tables into smaller, more manageable tables and establishing relationships between them using primary and foreign keys. 
- The main aim of normalization is to minimize data duplication and improve data integrity.

## What is an index in SQL?
- An index is a database structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. 
- It acts as a pointer to the data stored in the table, allowing for faster data access. 
- Indexes are created on one or more columns of a table and can significantly enhance the performance of queries that involve those columns.

## What is the difference between a clustered and a non-clustered index?
- In SQL, a clustered index determines the physical order of data rows in a table. 
- There can be only one clustered index per table, and it affects the way data is stored on disk.
- On the other hand, a non-clustered index does not alter the physical order of data. 
- It is created on one or more columns and contains a copy of the indexed columns along with a pointer to the actual data rows. 
- Multiple non-clustered indexes can be created on a table.

## What is the difference between a primary key and a unique key?
- A primary key is used to uniquely identify a record in a table and cannot contain null values.
- A unique key also enforces uniqueness but allows for null values (except when defined as NOT NULL). However, there can be multiple unique keys in a table, whereas there can be only one primary key.

## What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE commands?

- DELETE is a DML statement used to remove specific rows from a table based on a condition. It maintains transaction logs and can be rolled back.
- TRUNCATE is a DDL statement used to remove all rows from a table, effectively resetting the table. It does not maintain transaction logs and cannot be rolled back.

## What is the difference between a view and a table?

- A table is a basic database object that stores data in rows and columns. It is a physical representation of data.
- A view is a virtual table derived from one or more tables or other views. It does not store data physically but retrieves data dynamically based on the underlying tables or views. Views are used to simplify data access and provide a customized perspective on the data.

## Explain the difference between an INNER JOIN and an OUTER JOIN.
- INNER JOIN returns only the matching rows between two tables based on the join condition. It discards non-matching rows from both tables.
- OUTER JOIN returns all rows from one table and the matching rows from the other table. It preserves non-matching rows by filling the missing values with NULL.

## SQL query execution plan
FROM -> WHERE -> GROUP BY -> HAVING -> SELECT -> ORDER BY -> LIMIT
