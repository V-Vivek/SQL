# JOIN
- A JOIN is a way to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. 
- There are several types of joins, which return different subsets of the data based on the relationships between the tables. 
- A JOIN combines the data horizontally, resulting in a single table with the combined data.

# EXISTS 
- It is a type of subquery that is used to test if a row exists in a subquery table that meets certain conditions. 
- The EXISTS keyword returns a ***Boolean value of true or false***, indicating whether the subquery returns any rows. 
- The EXISTS keyword can be ***used to improve the performance of queries*** by returning a result faster than a JOIN, as it only needs to determine if the data exists, rather than returning the data itself.

***The choice between a JOIN and EXISTS depends on the requirements of the query. If you need to combine the data from multiple tables into a single result set, a join is the appropriate technique. If you only need to test for the existence of data in a subquery, then the EXISTS keyword is more efficient.***
